Foundation CSS + Atomic Design + SASS Placeholders

#How to use the placeholders
If you want to use the foundation placeholders, you *MUST* first import their 
regular foundation counterpart. For example, to use grid-placeholders, you must do this:

```
@import "bower_components/foundation/scss/foundation/components/grid";
@import "foundation-placeholders/grid-placeholders";
```
